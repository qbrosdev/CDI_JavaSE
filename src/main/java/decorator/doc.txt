Decorators and Interceptors are similar because they can be both used to "enrich" or "decorate" one method call
with additional tasks. However Interceptors are used for general tasks, which are not related with your class in
 particular (e.g. auditing). On the other hand, Decorators, do bear with them the Bean attributes/operations
 so they can actually specialize or override a specific business functionality
