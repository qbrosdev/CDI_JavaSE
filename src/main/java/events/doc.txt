To observe an event youâ€™ll have to add an "observer method" in an enable bean (bean should be alive)
of your application.

An observer method is a method whose "first parameter" has the @Observes annotation.
Off course qualifier may be added to the observer to restrict event triggering.
The observer method may have other beans as parameters.

Unlike java, CDI understands parameter "type erasure".

For instance take these 2 observer methods:

public void processNumberList(@Observes List<Number> event) {...}

public void processIntegerList(@Observes List<Integer> event) {...}

The container will make the distinction between both when resolving observer depending of the parameterized type of the event.
