<!--this is the old address for deployment descriptor file address
http://java.sun.com/xml/ns/javaee it dose not support some tags
this is the new address (for java EE7) http://xmlns.jcp.org/xml/ns/javaee/
Each Java EE XML Schema document's file name contains the specific version of the related specification.
This is introduced for convenience to locate specific versions of the schema documents.
However, Deployment Descriptor instances are not required to refer to a specific file.
Instead, an instance must specify the version of the corresponding specification by using the "version" attribute.
For example, servlet Deployment Descriptor instances that must be processed with the servlet 3.1 version must
indicate the version within the version attribute of the instance document, for example, "3.1".
The Deployment Descriptor processors use the version information to choose the appropriate version of the schema
document(s) to process the Deployment Descriptor instances

<!--xml schema loading process (defined in schema location):the XML parser will firstly try to load the schema from
internet, if not found or internet access is not available, it will search *.xsd file locally
from class path (project dependencies), if still not found, it will be omitted.
